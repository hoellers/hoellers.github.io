I have taught substantive classes as well as methods-oriented classes. I have a great passion for teaching; I view my role as a teacher as a support person for my students. My primary goal as a teacher is to make students engaged and active and to help them learn skills that they will be able to use outside of the contexts of any course and even their field of study. I believe that active participation is essential to helping students learn, and I structure courses in such a way that there are plenty of ways in which to participate and be active, as I recognize that not all students learn in the same way. I believe strongly that, given all of the challenges today's students face, being flexible and adaptive is necessary for a good instructor at any level.
