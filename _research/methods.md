description: My methodological research largely supports the substantive research agenda. My dissertation project explores three ways to facilitate and improve survey-based analysis. Other strands of this track explore measurement - I am particularly interested in measuring civil society and regime types. In all of these projects, I use a diverse array of methods, including machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and developing novel statistical models.

<i> Simon Hoellerbauer. "Distances in Latent Space: A Novel Approach to Analyzing Conjoints." Presented at 37<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology (Virtual), July 2020.* </i>

<blockquote> Often, we would like to place individuals in a latent space relative to other individuals or other fixed points within that space - politicians, tax plans, organizations, governments etc. We then want to know how the distance between an individual and such a fixed points affects that individual's attitudes and behaviors. Often, the location of these points in latent space are influenced by a constellation of attributes - policy positions for politicians, tax rates and coverages for tax plans, structure, membership, goals for organizations, performance in different categories for governments. This is really a **two-part process**, where closeness, decided by how individuals view an entity's traits, is the mechanism. I propose a methodological approach to studying this process: a two-part statistical model, where the first is an IRT model and the second is only limited by the nature of the secondary outcome variable. This project involves a novel conjoint study with substantive implications for individual engagement with civil society organizations. Analysis is done in the Bayesian framework, with both parts of the model estimated together. I situate this new approach this in the analysis of conjoint survey experiments, but it could be adapted to a diverse array of experimental approaches. </blockquote>

<i> Simon Hoellerbauer. "Using Mixture Models to Assess Enumerator and Survey Quality." Presented at 36<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting of the Society for Political Methodology, Cambridge, MA, July 2019.* </i>
<blockquote> Back checks{also called field audits or re-interviews{are a strategy for assessing survey and enumerator quality where comparisons are made between the original survey data and selected re-administered survey items, with the goal of identifying inconsistencies. Back checking is most often done deterministically. While in many situations this may suffce, small changes between the original and back check versions of a variable may not necessarily indicate enumerator failures, as individuals are known to provide somewhat different answers to some questions when asked at a different time, or if they do not remember their original answer. In addition, deterministic back checking does not provide a measure of uncertainty regarding whether there is a true discrepancy or not, nor does it provide an easy way to assess enumerator quality once discrepancies have been identified. I adapt the probabilistic record linkage model developed by Fellegi and Sunter (1969) to create a probabilistic model to assist with back checks. In order to assess how enumerators impact the probability that a backcheck observation "matches"" with its original survey counterpart, I directly model this probability, formulating it as a function of random intercepts by enumerator. I test the model in a Bayesian framework using fully simulated data and using data from a real-world survey. </blockquote>

<i>Brandon de la Cuesta, Jim Qian, and Simon Hoellerbauer. "Enumerator Effects in Experimental Research: Causes and Consequences for Inference in Survey and Lab-in-the-Field Experiments."*</i>
<blockquote> This project investigates an often ignored source of variation in survey and lab-in-field experiments: enumerators. We explore how ignoring or simply using enumerator fixed effects can lead to misleading results and affect inference. We theorize enumerators as carrying out different "versions" of experimental treatments. We develop a Bayesian model for taking enumerator effects into account when analyzing experimental and survey data. </blockquote>


<i>Simon Hoellerbauer. "Democracy vs Dictatorship or Something More?: Using Unsupervised Learning to Cluster Regimes." </i>
<blockquote> Political scientists categorize regimes because they believe there are important descriptive and causal differences between them, otherwise there would be no point to the exercise. There are, however, numerous-at times conflicting, at times overlapping-categorizations of regimes used in the political science literature. Often we rely on subjective coding that is also very time-consuming. It is not clear which categorizations are more "important," in the sense that they reflect intrinsically different regime types-researchers can make subjective decisions about which "aspect" of a regime may be more important, although this may not be reflected in execution. In this project, I use the wealth of indicators available in the V-Dem project to cluster regimes via K-Means clustering and Guassian mixture models. I find disagreement between existing categorical measures and the clusters returned by both algorithms.</blockquote>

<i>Simon Hoellerbauer. 2018. Reconceptualizing Civil Society and its Strength. Master's Thesis, UNC-Chapel Hill.</i>
<blockquote> What is Civil Society? Can we assess how strong it is? Using the problems present conceptualizations of civil society entail as a point of departure, this work develops a deffnition that strips civil society of its normative assumptions and functional form and fits better with the reality we observe. Civil society can be thought of as a space between the state, the market, and the family that can be divided into different sectors based on the goals of the civil organizations that inhabit it. The strength of each sector can be assessed by gauging how cohesive civil society organizations within that sector are, how embedded they are in the social fabric of society, and how developed their bureaucratic capital is. This work then sketches out how this approach can be used to analyze civil society in the United States and Armenia. In sum, it presents the basis for a new research agenda aims to investigate the relationship between civil society and democracy. </blockquote>
