description: Substantively, I study the political economy of development. I am particularly interested in the role that civil society organizations such as NGOs and grassroots organizations play in development and how development support from donors - both private and from other states - affects civil society organizations and civil societies in recipient countries. I use survey experiments, field experiments, and other innovative causal inference methods in these projects.

<i>Simon Hoellerbauer. "Why Join? How Civil Society Organizations' Attributes Signal Congruence and Impact Community Engagement." **Journal of Experimental Political Science**, Online FirstView</i>
<blockquote>	Civil society organizations (CSOs) can facilitate collective action. This makes understanding what shapes whether people are likely to engage with CSOs critically important. This paper argues that whether an organization is perceived as congruent --- similar to an individual in values --- is a key determinant of whether individuals will engage with it. I use a conjoint survey experiment to test how organizational attributes signaling congruence influence respondents' willingness to attend a hypothetical organization's meetings. I find that individuals are more likely to choose organizations that are more likely to be congruent with them, except when it comes to funding. These findings imply that an individual's level of comfort with a CSO matters for engagement; thus, CSOs need to consider how they match to their publics when reaching out to potential joiners. Furthermore, donors seeking to support CSOs need to pay attention to their impact on perceptions of congruence.  </blockquote>

<i> Simon Hoellerbauer, Maria Nagawa, Graeme Robertson, Jeremy Springman, and Erik Wibbels. "The Effect of Government Intervention on the Operational Decision of NGOs: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in Three Countries." <i/>
<blockquote> Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often play dual roles. In many countries, they provide critical services that improve citizen well-being. However, NGOs have also been credited with sparking popular mobilization, accountability, and even regime change. In response to these dual roles as service providers and advocates, many governments have deployed a mix of accommodating and coercive strategies toward NGOs. To date, there is no rigorous evidence on how these diverse strategies impact NGOs. We provide insight through a conjoint experiment on directors and managers of 485 NGOs in Cambodia, Uganda and Serbia. The results speak to how government behavior impacts \textit{where} NGOs prefer to work, \textit{how} they operate, and \textit{which} civic actors they are willing to engage with. We show that NGOs prefer to avoid communities where local governments use more repression, cooptation, and anti-NGO rhetoric. We also find that government coercion decreases the likelihood that NGOs will partner with a wide range of civic actors. These findings have important implications for the ability of NGOs to create meaningful political change in an era of growing government restrictions. </blockquote>

<i>Lucy Martin, Brigitte Seim, Simon Hoellerbauer, and Luis Camacho. "Marketing Taxation? Experimental Evidence on Enforcement and Bargaining in Malawian Markets."</i>
<blockquote> Many developing countries experience a problematic cycle of low tax revenues, low public service provision, and low accountability. However, there is limited empirical evidence surrounding how to interrupt this cycle, especially whether it is more effective to improve the state's capacity to monitor and enforce taxation, or to instead strengthen taxpayers' motivation to pay taxes voluntarily. This paper presents the results of a field experiment conducted in 128 markets in Malawi. We use a 2x2 factorial design to compare the effectiveness of improving enforcement (via a bundle of ``top-down'' treatments) vs. targeting quasi-voluntary compliance (via a bundle of ``bottom-up'' treatments). We find encouraging evidence that the interventions increased tax compliance. At endline, vendors in treatment markets were significantly more likely to have a tax payment receipt, which is the measure of tax compliance least vulnerable to measurement error. While we also find higher revenues in the top-down treatment markets at endline, we cannot eliminate the possibility that there were pre-treatment differences in revenue levels. We also find significant effects on intermediate outcomes that suggest causal mechanisms. The bottom-up intervention bundle significantly increased vendors' satisfaction with services and their belief that paying taxes is a duty. In the top-down treatment group, vendors were more likely to report that they paid taxes because there were consequences if they did not, tax collectors report working longer hours, and vendors perceive lower bribe-taking. These findings suggest that local revenue collection can be kickstarted in a developing context, particularly by enhancing accountability and transparency surrounding tax revenue to, in turn, increase taxpayers' willingness to pay taxes. </blockquote>

<i>Lucy Martin, Brigitte Seim, and Simon Hoellerbauer. "Investigating Tax Policy Preferences Among Citizens in Weak-State Contexts."</i>
<blockquote> This paper uses a conjoint survey experiment carried out among market vendors in Malawi to assess tax plan preferences in weak-state contexts. We examine whether there is a trade-off between plans that citizens would support and those by which they would actually abide. </blockquote>

<i>Simon Hoellerbauer and Jacob Smith. "Populism as a Determinant of Foreign Aid Allocation." Presented at 76<sup>th</sup> Annual Conference of the Midwest Political Science Association, Chicago, IL, April 2018. </i>
<blockquote> In this paper, we examine how the ideology of the governing party(ies) in advanced Western democracies impacts the money budgeted for economic development and democracy assistance purposes. In this context, we explore the influence of populist parties on this process. We expect that center right and center left governments will support investment in foreign aid in the absence of parties with populist tendencies. The further parties are from the ideological center, the less likely parties will be to advocate for increased foreign aid. We theorize that populist parties will seek to direct investment to other priorities. Thus, we hypothesize that foreign aid spending will fall when populist parties are in government. Contrary to expectations, however, we do find a significant effect for populist parties, but do find that center-right governments (but not center-left governments) spend more on foreign aid than do governments with other ideological orientations. Going forward, we will continue to investigate the factors resulting in this surprising finding. </blockquote>
