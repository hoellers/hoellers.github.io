description: Substantively, I study the political economy of development. I am particularly interested in the role that civil society organizations such as NGOs and grassroots organizations play in development and how development support from donors - both private and from other states - affects civil society organizations and civil societies in recipient countries. I use survey experiments, field experiments, and other innovative causal inference methods in these projects.

<i>Simon Hoellerbauer. "'Localness', Organizational Attributes, and Civic Engagement with Civil Society." Revise and Resumbit at **Journal of Experimental Political Science**</i>
<blockquote>		Civil society organizations (CSOs) can serve as facilitators of collective action. This makes understanding engagement with CSOs critical to the study of the collective action problem. This paper argues that whether an organization is perceived as local is a key determinant of whether individuals will engage with it. I use a conjoint survey experiment to test how organizational attributes that signal localness influence respondents' willingness to attend a hypothetical organization's meetings. I find that individuals are more likely to choose organizations that are more local in nature, except when it comes to funding, where there are no detectable differences as funding source varies. These findings imply that an individual's level of comfort with a CSO matters for engagement; thus, CSOs need to consider their localness when reaching out to potential joiners. In addition, donors seeking to support CSOs need to pay attention to their impacts on localness.  </blockquote>

<blockquote> Many developing countries experience a problematic cycle of low tax revenues, low public service provision, and low accountability. However, there is limited empirical evidence surrounding how to interrupt this cycle, especially whether it is more effective to improve the state's capacity to monitor and enforce taxation, or to instead strengthen taxpayers' motivation to pay taxes voluntarily. This paper presents the results of a field experiment conducted in 128 markets in Malawi. We use a 2x2 factorial design to compare the effectiveness of improving enforcement (via a bundle of ``top-down'' treatments) vs. targeting quasi-voluntary compliance (via a bundle of ``bottom-up'' treatments). We find encouraging evidence that the interventions increased tax compliance. At endline, vendors in treatment markets were significantly more likely to have a tax payment receipt, which is the measure of tax compliance least vulnerable to measurement error. While we also find higher revenues in the top-down treatment markets at endline, we cannot eliminate the possibility that there were pre-treatment differences in revenue levels. We also find significant effects on intermediate outcomes that suggest causal mechanisms. The bottom-up intervention bundle significantly increased vendors' satisfaction with services and their belief that paying taxes is a duty. In the top-down treatment group, vendors were more likely to report that they paid taxes because there were consequences if they did not, tax collectors report working longer hours, and vendors perceive lower bribe-taking. These findings suggest that local revenue collection can be kickstarted in a developing context, particularly by enhancing accountability and transparency surrounding tax revenue to, in turn, increase taxpayers' willingness to pay taxes. </blockquote>

<blockquote> This paper uses a conjoint survey experiment carried out among market vendors in Malawi to assess tax plan preferences in weak-state contexts. We examine whether there is a trade-off between plans that citizens would support and those by which they would actually abide. </blockquote>

<i>Simon Hoellerbauer and Jacob Smith. "Populism as a Determinant of Foreign Aid Allocation." Presented at 76<sup>th</sup> Annual Conference of the Midwest Political Science Association, Chicago, IL, April 2018. </i>
<blockquote> In this paper, we examine how the ideology of the governing party(ies) in advanced Western democracies impacts the money budgeted for economic development and democracy assistance purposes. In this context, we explore the influence of populist parties on this process. We expect that center right and center left governments will support investment in foreign aid in the absence of parties with populist tendencies. The further parties are from the ideological center, the less likely parties will be to advocate for increased foreign aid. We theorize that populist parties will seek to direct investment to other priorities. Thus, we hypothesize that foreign aid spending will fall when populist parties are in government. Contrary to expectations, however, we do find a significant effect for populist parties, but do find that center-right governments (but not center-left governments) spend more on foreign aid than do governments with other ideological orientations. Going forward, we will continue to investigate the factors resulting in this surprising finding. </blockquote>
